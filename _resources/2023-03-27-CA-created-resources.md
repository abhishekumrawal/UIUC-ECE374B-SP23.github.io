### Teaching document development

Creating new content is *difficult* and usually a task for me and the TAs. However, a few CAs have taken up the challenge of making new content: 

- [Jigsaw problem reduction](/lectures/Lec22.html)
  - Manuscript: [pdf](/materials/extra_content/Jigsaw_Sumedh.pdf)
  - Author: Sumedh Vemuganti

- [Even more DP problems (Extra Lab)](/lectures/Lec14.html)
  - Manuscript: [Questions](/materials/extra_content/lab12-new.pdf) [Solutions](/materials/extra_content/lab12-sol-new.pdf)
  - Author: Hamza Husain

- NFA-to-DFA subset construction **(TBA)**:
  - Author: Mike Montano
 
### Animations 

Animations are a great way to help explain concepts. A few CAs have used the [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) library to create some animations for some of the more difficult course topics: 

- [Language Transformation example](/lectures/Lec4.html):   
  - Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuZFHpmOotQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuZFHpmOotQ)
  - Code: [https://github.com/kevtool/ECE374_Video](https://github.com/kevtool/ECE374_Video)
  - Author: Kevin Lim

- [Reductions example](/lectures/Lec21.html): 
  - Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWWXXwp1Ya8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWWXXwp1Ya8)
  - Code: [https://github.com/kevtool/ECE374_Video](https://github.com/kevtool/ECE374_Video)
  - Author: Kevin Lim

- [LIS explainer](/lectures/Lec13.html): 
  - Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buB-VifgeNE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buB-VifgeNE)

- [Topological Sort]() **(TBA)**:

### Problem development

Last semester (and part of this one) I conscripted quite a few CAs to develop problems for a new algorithms course I'm developing specifically for ECE. That course unfortunately got delayed (though I'm still working on it and it will be approved soon). I have these problems in a repo waiting to be deployed but until they are, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to the following individuals for developing the following problems. 

- Jeep Kaewla
  - Problem: Find windows of string S that has characters of T
    - Concept Tested: Hashing
  - Problem: Rotodrome
    - Concept Tested: Hashing

- Erin Kim
  - Problem: Poker chips
    - Concept Tested: Dynamic programming

- Frederick Lee
  - Problem: Traversal of Trees
    - Concept Tested: BFS/DFS
  - Problem: Majority SAT
    - Concept Tested: Approximate algorithms

- Kevin Lim
  - Problem: Matching stick lengths
    - Concept Tested: Divide and Conquer
  - Problem: Index-value matching
    - Concept Tested: Divide and Conquer
  - Problem: Vertex with cost
    - Concept Tested: Shortest paths

- Ayu Seiya
  - Problem: horse racing
    - Concept Tested: Data Structures
  - Problem: Expression tree evaluation
    - Concept Tested: BFS/DFS

- Qing Wang
  - Problem: Parentheses matching
   - Concept Tested: Data Structures
  - Problem: Mother vertex
    - Concept Tested: Directed graphs 

- Zikui Wang
  - Problem: Seating arrangements 
    - Concept Tested: BFS/DFS
  - Problem: Arbitrage 
    - Concept Tested: Dynamic programming
  - Problem: 3Color to SAT reduction 
    - Concept Tested: reductions

Watch out for these problems coming to a course near you soon (once that course is launched I will make sure you guys get your due there as well).

### Infrastructure support

I'd like to also mention the following CAs how have helped develop the backend systems of the course: 

- New course infrastructure - Erin Kim
- New course website - Rubin Zou
