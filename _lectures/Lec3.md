### Deterministic Finite Automata
#### **Graphical Representation**: 
- DFAs are collections of states (vertices) with directed transitions (edges) that are labeled with symbols from an input set $\Sigma$
- Each state has exactly one outgoing transition for each symbol in $\Sigma$
- There is a unique state labeled the start state which is represented by an input arrow
- There is a unique set of states labeled the accepting states which are represented by double circles 
#### **Formal Representation**: Defined by 5 tuples $M = (Q, \Sigma, s, A, \delta)$
- $Q$ is a finite set of states 
- $\Sigma$ is a finite set inputs 
- $s \in Q$ is the start state 
- $A\subset Q$ are the accepting states 
- $\delta: Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q$ are the state transitions
#### **Example**:
- $Q$ = \{ $q_0,q_1$ \}
- $\Sigma$ = \{ $0,1$  \}
- $s$ = $q_0$
- $A$ = \{ $q_1$ \}
- $\delta(q_0,0) = q_0$,  $\delta(q_1,1) = q_1$,  $\delta(q_0,1) = q_1$,  $\delta(q_1,0) = q_0$

#### **Definitions**:
- DFA M accepts a string w iff the unique walk begining at the start state and sequentially inputing the symbols in w ends on an accepts state.
- The language accepted (or recognized) by a DFA is the set of strings accepted by the DFA

**Formal Definitions**:
- A state transition with string input w is defined by $\delta^\ast(q,w) = \delta^\ast (\delta(q,a),x)$ where $w = ax$
- The language $L(M)$ accepted by a DFA $M = (Q, \Sigma, s, A, \delta)$ is defined as $L(M)$ = \{ $w \in \Sigma^\ast | \delta^\ast(s,w)\in A$ \}

### Theorems
#### **Languages accepted by DFAs are closed under compliment**

If $L$ is accepted by $M_1 = (Q, \Sigma, s, A, \delta)$, then $\bar{L}$ is accepted by $M_2 = (Q, \Sigma, s, \bar{A}, \delta)$ where

- $\bar{A}$ = \{ $q\in Q | q \notin A$ \}
<br>

**Example:**

#### **Languages accepted by DFAs are closed under intersection**

If $L_1$ is accepted by $M_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma, s_1, A_1, \delta_1)$ and $L_2$ is accepted by $M_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma, s_2, A_2, \delta_2)$ then $L_1 \cap L_2$ is accepted by $M = (Q, \Sigma, s, A, \delta)$ where

- $Q$ = $Q_1 \times Q_2$
- $s$ = $(s_1,s_2)$
- $A$ = \{ $(q,w)\in Q | q \in A_1 \text{ and } w \in A_2$ \}
- $\delta((q,w),a) = (\delta_1(q,a),\delta_2(w,a))$
<br>

**Example:**

#### **Languages accepted by DFAs are closed under union**

If $L_1$ is accepted by $M_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma, s_1, A_1, \delta_1)$ and $L_2$ is accepted by $M_1 = (Q_1, \Sigma, s_2, A_2, \delta_2)$ then $L_1 \cap L_2$ is accepted by $M = (Q, \Sigma, s, A, \delta)$ where

- $Q$ = $Q_1 \times Q_2$
- $s$ = $(s_1,s_2)$
- $A$ = \{ $(q,w)\in Q | q \in A_1 \text{ or } w \in A_2$ \}
- $\delta((q,w),a) = (\delta_1(q,a),\delta_2(w,a))$
