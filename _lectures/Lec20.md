<h5>Introduction</h5>

In algorithms we reduce a new problem to known solved one!

<h6> Reductions for decision problems | languages </h6>

- R : Reduction X &rarr; Y
- $A_Y$ : Algorithm for Y
- $A_X$: New algorithm for X
- $I_X$: Instance of X
- $I_Y$: Instance of Y

We can say that if R and $A_Y$ are polynomial-time algorithms, $A_X$ is also polynomial-time.

- Reductions allow us to formalize the notion of “Problem X is no harder to solve than Problem Y”
- If Problem X reduces to Problem Y (we write X $\leq$ Y), then X cannot be harder to solve than Y
- More generally, if X $\leq$ Y, we can say that X is no harder than Y, or Y is at least as hard as X. X $\leq$ Y:
    - X is no harder than Y, or
    - Y is at least as hard as X

<h5>Examples of Reduction</h5>

<h6>Independent Sets and Cliques</h6>

Given a graph G, a set of vertices V' is:

- **An Independent set**: if no two vertices of V' are connected by an edge of G.
- **Clique** : if every pair of vertices in V' is connected by an edge of G.

We can reduce Independent Set to Clique. An instance of Independent Set is a graph G and an integer k. The reduction given $\langle G, k\rangle$ outputs $\langle G', k\rangle$  where G' is the complement of G. G' has an edge uv &harr; uv is not an edge of G.
So,

G has an independent set of size k &harr; G' has a clique of size k.

- Independent Set $\leq$$_P$ Clique.
- Clique is at least as hard as Independent Set.

To show Clique $\leq$$_P$ Independent Set :

Reduction figure:

- $I_X$ = $\langle G' \rangle$ 
- $A_X$ = Clique
- $I_Y$ = $\langle G\rangle$ 
- $A_Y$ = Independent Set
- R : G' = {V, E'}

Clique and Independent Set are polynomial-time equivalent because:

- Independent Set $\leq$$_P$ Clique
- Clique $\leq$$_P$ Independent Set

<h6>Independent Set and Vertex Cover</h6>

Given a graph G = (V, E), a set of vertices S is:
 - A **vertex cover** if every e $\in$ E has at least one endpoint in S

Let G = (V, E) be a graph. S is an Independent Set &harr; V \ S is a vertex cover.

To show Independent Set  $\leq$$_P$ Vertex Cover:
- G : graph with n vertices, and an integer k be an instance of the Independent Set problem.
- G has an independent set of size $\geq$ k  &harr; G has a vertex cover of size $\leq$ n-k

Reduction figure:

<img src="/img/lectures/Lec20/R1.png" alt="Concatenation" style="width: 420px;"> 

- $I_X$ = $\langle G\rangle$
- $A_X$ = Independent Set(G, k)
- $I_Y$ = $\langle G\rangle$ 
- $A_Y$ = Vertex Cover(G, n-k)
- R : G' = G

(G, k) is an instance of Independent Set, and (G, n - k) is an instance of Vertex Cover with the same answer.Therefore,

- Independent Set  $\leq$$_P$ Vertex Cover
- Vertex Cover $\leq$$_P$ Independent Set

<h5>NFAs | DFAs and Universality</h5>

A DFA M is universal if it accepts every string. That is, L(M) = $\Sigma^*$, the set of all strings.

- To solve DFA Universality, we check if a DFA M has any reachable non-final state.

A NFA N is said to be universal if it accepts every string. That is, L(N) = $\Sigma^*$, the set of all strings.
 - To we solve NFA Universality, we reduce it to DFA Universality. 
 - Given an NFA N, convert it to an equivalent DFA M, and use the DFA Universality Algorithm.
- The above reduction takes exponential time.
- NFA Universality is known to be PSPACE-Complete.

<h5>Polynomial-time reductions</h5>

We say that an algorithm is efficient if it runs in polynomial-time. A polynomial time reduction from a decision problem X to a decision problem Y is an algorithm A that has the following properties:
- Given an instance $I_X$ of X, A produces an instance $I_Y$ of Y
- A runs in time polynomial in  $\|I_X\|$.
- Answer to $I_X$ YES &harr; answer to $I_Y$ is YES.

 If X $\leq$$_P$ Y then a polynomial time algorithm for Y implies a polynomial time algorithm for X.

Such a reduction is called a Karp reduction. Karp reductions are the same as mapping reductions when specialized to polynomial time for the reduction step.
