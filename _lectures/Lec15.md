<h4> I. Undirected graphs </h4>

<h5> Definition </h5>

An undirected (simple) graph G = (V, E) is a 2-tuple: 
- V is a set of vertices (also referred to as nodes/points) 
- E is a set of edges where each edge e belong to E is a set of the form {u, v} with u, v belong to V and u not equala to v.
<br> 
<img src="/img/lectures/Lec15/fig_graph.jpg" alt="graph" style="width: 320px;"><br><br>
Example: In figure, G= (V,E) where V = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} ;
E = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 7), (3, 8), (4, 5), (5, 6), (7, 8)}

<h5> Notation and Convention </h5>

An edge in an undirected graphs is an unordered pair of nodes and hence it is a set. Conventionally we use uv for {u, v} when it is clear from the context that the graph is undirected. 
- u and v are the end points of an edge {u, v}
- Multi-graphs allow:
    - loops which are edges with the same node appearing as both end points
	- multi-edges: diferent edges between same pairs of nodes

<h5> Graph Representation I - Adjacency Matrix  </h5>

Represent G = (V, E) with n vertices and m edges using a n x n adjacency matrix A where
- A[i, j] = A[j, i] = 1 if {i, j} $\in$ E and A[i, j] = A[j, i] = 0 if {i, j} $\notin$ E. 
- Advantage: can check if {i, j} $\in$ E in O(1) time
- Disadvantage: needs $\Omega$ ($n^2$) space even when m << n$^2$

Example:
<table border='0'> 
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="/img/lectures/Lec15/rep1_graph.png" alt="text" style="width: 180px;">
    </td>   
    <td>
    <img src="/img/lectures/Lec15/arrow.png" alt="text" style="width: 50px;">
    </td> 
    <td>
    <img src="/img/lectures/Lec15/rep1_matrix.png" alt="text" style="width: 320px;">
    </td>  
  </tr>
</table>

<br>
<h5> Graph Representation II - Adjacency List  </h5>

Represent G = (V, E) with n vertices and m edges using adjacency lists:
- For each u $\in$ V, Adj(u) = {v | {u, v} $\in$ E}, that is neighbors of u. Sometimes Adj(u) is the list of edges incident to u.
- Advantage: space is O(m + n)
- Disadvantage: cannot “easily” determine in O(1) time whether {i, j} $\in$ E
    - By sorting each list, one can achieve O(log n) time
    - By hashing “appropriately”, one can achieve O(1) time.

Example:
<table border='0'> 
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="/img/lectures/Lec15/rep1_graph.png" alt="text" style="width: 180px;">
    </td>   
    <td>
    <img src="/img/lectures/Lec15/arrow.png" alt="text" style="width: 50px;">
    </td> 
    <td>
    <img src="/img/lectures/Lec15/rep2_list.png" alt="text" style="width: 220px;">
    </td>  
  </tr>
</table> 

<br>
<h5> Concrete Representation  </h5>

Assume vertices are numbered arbitrarily as {1, 2,..., n}.
- Edges are numbered arbitrarily as {1, 2,..., m}. 
- Edges stored in an array/list of size m. E[j] is j$^{th}$ edge with info on end points which are integers in range 1 to n. 
- Array Adj of size n for adjacency lists. Adj[i] points to adjacency list of vertex i. Adj[i] is a list of edge indices in range 1 to m.
<table border='0'> 
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img src="/img/lectures/Lec15/fig1.png" alt="text" style="width: 450px;">
    </td>   
    <td>
    <img src="/img/lectures/Lec15/fig2.png" alt="text" style="width: 450px;">
    </td>  
  </tr>
</table> 
 

- Advantages:
    - Edges are explicitly represented/numbered. Scanning/processing all edges easy to do.
    - Representation easily supports multigraphs including self-loops.
    - Explicit numbering of vertices and edges allows use of arrays: O(1)-time operations are easy to understand. 
    - Can also implement via pointer based lists for certain dynamic graph settings.



<h5> Connectivity  </h5>

Given a graph G = (V, E):
- path: sequence of distinct vertices $v_1$ , $v_2$ ,..., $v_k$ such that $v_i$ $v_{i+1}$ $\in$ E for 1 $\le$ i $\le$ k-1. The length of the path is k-1 (the number of edges in the path) and the path is from v$_1$ to v$_k$. Note: a single vertex u is a path of length 0.
- cycle: sequence of distinct vertices $v_1$, $v_2$,..., $v_k$ such that {$v_i$, $v_{i+1}$} $\in$ E for 1 $\le$ i $\le$ k1 and {$v_1$, $v_k$} $\in$ E. Single vertex not a cycle according to this defnition.
- Caveat: Some times people use the term cycle to also allow vertices to be repeated; we will use the term tour.
- A vertex u is connected to v if there is a path from u to v.
- The connected component of u, con(u), is the set of all vertices connected to u. 
- In undirected graphs, connectivity is a refexive, symmetric, and transitive relation. Connected components are the equivalence classes.
- Graph is connected if there is only one connected component.In undirected graphs, connectivity is a refexive, symmetric, and transitive relation. Connected components are the equivalence classes.
- Graph is connected if there is only one connected component.

<h5> Basic Graph Search in Undirected Graphs:  </h5>

Given G = (V,E) and vertex u $\in$ V. Let n = |V|. Then:<br>
<img src="/img/lectures/Lec15/algo1.png" alt="text" style="width: 400px;">
<br>
Running time : O(n+m)

- Special cases :
    - Breadth First Search (BFS): use queue data structure to implementing the list.
    - Depth First Search (DFS): use stack data structure to implement the list.

- Search tree: One can create a natural search tree T rooted at u during search.

<h4> II. Directed graphs </h4>

<h5> Definition  </h5>

- A directed graph G = (V, E) consists of
    - set of vertices/nodes V and
    - a set of edges/arcs E \subseteq V x V.
- An edge is an ordered pair of vertices. (u, v) diferent from (v, u).
- Examples:
    - Road networks with one-way streets.
    - Web-link graph: vertices are web-pages and there is an edge from page p1 to page p2 if p1 has a link to p2.
    - Web graphs used by Google with PageRank algorithm to rank pages.
    - Dependency graphs in variety of applications: link from x to y if y depends on x. Make fles for compiling programs.
    - Program Analysis: functions/procedures are vertices and there is an edge from x to y if x calls y.

<h5> Representation  </h5>

Graph G = (V, E) with n vertices and m edges:
- Adjacency Matrix: n x n asymmetric matrix A. A[u, v] = 1 if (u, v) $\in$ E and A[u, v] = 0 if (u, v) $\notin$ E. A[u, v] is not same as A[v, u].
- Adjacency Lists: for each node u, Out(u) (also referred to as Adj(u)) and In(u) store out-going edges and in-coming edges from u.

<h5> Directed Connectivity  </h5>

Given a graph G = (V, E):
- A (directed) path is a sequence of distinct vertices $v_1$ , $v_2$ ,..., $v_k$ such that ($v_i$, $v_{i+1}$) $\in$ E for 1 $\le$ i $\le$ k-1. The length of the path is k-1 and the path is from $v_1$ to $v_k$. By convention, a single node u is a path of length 0.
- A cycle is a sequence of distinct vertices $v_1$ , $v_2$ ,..., $v_k$ such that ($v_i$, $v_{i+1}$) $\in$ E for 1 $\le$ i $\le$ k-1 and ($v_k$, $v_1$) $\in$ E. By convention, a single node u is not a cycle.
- A vertex u can reach v if there is a path from u to v. Alternatively v can be reached from u
- Let rch(u) be the set of all vertices reachable from u.

Example of Asymmetricity: D can reach B but B cannot reach D.

<h5> Strong Connected Components  </h5>

- Defnition: Given a directed graph G, u is strongly connected to v if u can reach v and v can reach u. In other words v $\in$ rch(u) and u $\in$ rch(v). 
- Define relation C where uCv if u is (strongly) connected to v.
- Proposition: C is an equivalence relation, that is refexive, symmetric and transitive.
- Equivalence classes of C: strong connected components of G. They partition the vertices of G.
- SCC(u): strongly connected component containing u.

<h5> Basic Graph Search Properties  </h5>

- Proposition : Explore(G, u) terminates with S = rch(u).
- Proof Sketch.
    - Once Visited[i] is set to TRUE it never changes. Hence a node is added only once to ToExplore. Thus algorithm terminates in at most n iterations of while loop.
    - By induction on iterations, can show v ∈ S ⇒ v ∈ rch(u)
    - Since each node v ∈ S was in ToExplore and was explored, no edges in G leave S. Hence no node in V − S is in rch(u).
    - Caveat: In directed graphs edges can enter S.
    - Thus S = rch(u) at termination
