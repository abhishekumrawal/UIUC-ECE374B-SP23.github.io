<h4> Recursion </h4>

Recursion is a special case of reduction.
- A special case of reduction 
- Rduce problem to a smaller instance of itself
- Self-reduction
- Problem instance of size n is reduced to one or more instances of size n 1 or less. 
- For termination, problem instances of small size are solved by some other method as base cases. 

<h4> Recursion in Algorithmic design </h4>

- Tail Recursion: problem reduced to a single recursive call after some work. Easy to convert algorithm into iterative or greedy algorithms. 
Examples: Interval scheduling, MST algorithms etc.
- Divide and Conquer: Problem reduced to multiple independent sub-problems that are solved separately. Conquer step puts together solution for bigger problem. 
Examples: Closest pair, median selection, quick sort. 
- Backtracking: Refinement of brute force search. Build solution incrementally by invoking recursion to try all possibilities for the decision in each step. 
- Dynamic Programming: problem reduced to multiple (typically) dependent or overlapping sub-problems. Use memorization to avoid re-computation of common solutions leading to iterative bottom-up algorithm

<h4> Backtracking </h4>

A backtracking algorithm tries to construct a solution to a computational problem
incrementally, one small piece at a time. Whenever the algorithm needs to
decide between multiple alternatives to the next component of the solution, it
recursively evaluates every alternative and then chooses the best one.

<h4> State Tree </h4>
A state space tree is a tree constructed from all of the possible states of the problem as nodes, connected via state transitions from some initial state as root to some terminal state as a leaf.

<h4> Example 1 - The Queens problem </h4>

Problem - 
1. How many queens can one place on the board?
2. Can one place 8 queens on the board?

Process:

    Initial board with Queen 1 placement.
    </td>
    <td>
    All the possible places that the current queen can go to.

    <td>
    Queen 2 placement.
    </td>   
    <td>
    Final 8-Queen problem solved in 1850 (published in 1848)
    </td> 
  </tr>
</table>

Problem : 
- How to solve problem for general n?

Intuition:
- Queens can’t be on the same row, column or diagonal
- Can have n queens max.


Search tree for 5 queens:
<img src="/img/lectures/Lec12/state_tree.png" alt="text" style="width: 1000px;">

Each node in the state tree represents a board state. For eg. node 135 represents a board where the queens placed on column 1,3 and 5. The leaf nodes represent the final state of the board where either 5 queens are placed or it cannot proceed further.

Hence, we recursively search over an implicit tree, where we “backtrack” if certain possibilities do not work.

<h4> Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) </h4>


Definitions:
- Sequence: an ordered list $a_1$, $a_{2}$,..., $a_{n}$. Length of a sequence is number of elements in the list.
- Subsequence: $a_{i1}$ ,..., $a_{ik}$ is a subsequence of $a_{1}$,..., $a_{n}$ if 1 $\le$ $i_{1}$ < $i_{2}$ <...< $i_{k}$ $\le$ n.
- Increasing sequence: A sequence is increasing if $a_{1}$ < $a_{2}$ <...< $a_{n}$. It is non-decreasing if $a_{1}$ $\le$ $a_{2}$ $\le$ ... $\le$ $a_{n}$. Similarly decreasing and non-increasing.

Problem:
- Input: A sequence of numbers $a_{1}$ , $a_{2}$,..., $a_{n}$
- Goal: Find an increasing subsequence $a_{i1}$ , $a_{i2}$ ,..., $a_{ik}$ of maximum length


1. Naive solution:
<br>
<img src="/img/lectures/Lec12/algo_naive.png" alt="text" style="width: 600px;" class="center>
<br><br>
Running time: O(n$2^n$) for $2^n$ subsequences of a sequence of length n and O(n) time to check
if a given sequence is increasing.

2. Recursive solution for LIS(A[1..n]):
- Case 1: Does not contain A[n] in which case LIS(A[1..n]) = LIS(A[1..(n − 1)])
- Case 2: Contains A[n] in which case LIS(A[1..n]) is not so clear.
- Note: For second case we want to find a subsequence in A[1..(n − 1)] that is restricted to numbers less than A[n]. This suggests that a more general problem is LIS_smaller(A[1..n], x) which gives the longest increasing subsequence in A where each number in the sequence is less than x.

<h4> General pattern </h4>

Backtracking algorithms are commonly used to make a sequence of decisions, with
the goal of building a recursively defined structure satisfying certain constraints.
Often (but not always) this goal structure is itself a sequence. For example:
- In the n-queens problem, the goal is a sequence of queen positions, one in
each row, such that no two queens attack each other. For each row, the
algorithm decides where to place the queen.
- In the LIS problem, the goal is a sequence of input elements that
have an increasing order of value. For each input element, the algorithm decides whether
to include it in the output sequence or not.
